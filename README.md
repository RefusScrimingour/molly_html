# Molly's Birthday!
This is an app I made for one of my friend's birthdays. I was just getting into flutter at the time, so I thought it'd be a good way to learn to put my skills to practical use. Being a flutter project, it probably wasn't meant to be run as a website (building to chrome was in alpha at the time) so it probably wasn't the smartest idea, but fun nonetheless. 

### How it works
The app just uses a flutter frontend combined with a Firebase backend. This just stores all the "facts about molly" in a Firestore container, and serves them to the user on launch. The rest is done in Flutter (the animations, page building, etc), and I drew the card in SketchBook on my iPad (don't judge my drawing skills :P)

## Note:
Unfortunately, I wasn't using GitHub too extensively back when I created this, so the actual archival process wasn't exactly ideal. In other words, though the website in the gh-pages branch is the most up to date version, the source code in master is actually a bit out of date, back when I only had the last page. This means that if you want to go through the code, you won't be able to see all my progress, which is a bit dissapointing :( <br>
welp
